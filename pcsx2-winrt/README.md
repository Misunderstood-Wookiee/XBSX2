# Build Instructions

Download the `cheats_ws.zip` and `cheats_ni.zip` files from here: https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2_patches/releases,

Then move them to the [bin/resources](https://github.com/SirMangler/pcsx2/tree/master/bin/resources) folder.

Once that's done open the `pcsx_qt.sln` file, and choose the `Release` configuration to make SSE4 builds (compatible with Xbox One consoles), or select the `Release AVX2` Configuration to make AVX2 builds (faster, but only works on the Xbox Series consoles).
